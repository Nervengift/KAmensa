A small python lib to access mealplans for canteens of Studentenwerk Karlsruhe

The API (if you can call 3 URLs an API) and credentials where extracted from the [UNIverse Android-App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studentenwerk&hl=de)

This is the **Python 3** version. For a *Python 2* compatible version see [NiciDieNase's original](https://github.com/NiciDieNase/KAmensa)

It is still work in progress!
